      "correct_option_id": 2,
      "explanation": "Prolonged post-operative antibiotic administration is not supported by current evidence and increases risks. While a single pre-operative dose is standard, extending parenteral antibiotics for 2-4 days was a practice in some older protocols, especially for contaminated cases. However, modern guidelines emphasize limiting antibiotic duration to reduce resistance and complications like C. difficile. For routine prophylaxis, a single dose is sufficient. Longer courses are reserved for established infections, not prophylaxis.",

      "explanation": "In a healthy individual with adequate glycogen stores and IV fluid support, the body can tolerate a short period of starvation. Significant protein catabolism is generally spared for the first few days as the body utilizes glycogen and begins to transition to fat metabolism. By day 4, however, glycogen stores are depleted, and if nutritional support is not initiated, the body will begin to rely more heavily on gluconeogenesis from amino acids, leading to a notable increase in protein breakdown.",

The hypotension (SBP 65) combined with bradycardia (HR 50) is the classic presentation of neurogenic shock, which is caused by the C4 vertebral dislocation. The underlying mechanism of neurogenic shock is a massive peripheral vasodilatation due to the loss of sympathetic nervous system tone. Concurrently, the patient has a severe head trauma, evidenced by the large epidural hematoma and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 5. While isolated severe head injury typically causes hypertension (Cushing's reflex), it is a critical part of the patient's overall state.

However, it can sometimes be associated with microcalcifications on a mammogram, which may prompt a biopsy leading to its diagnosis. The presence of microcalcifications is more commonly associated with Ductal Carcinoma In-situ (DCIS), but can be seen with LCIS as well.",
