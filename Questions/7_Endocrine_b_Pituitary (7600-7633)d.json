        "TTT of choice of GH secreting adenoma is trans sphenoidal surgical excision of adenoma",
        "Drug therapy is important in management of GH adenoma",

      "explanation": "Cytotoxic chemotherapy is NOT standard for GH adenomas. Surgery is first-line, and medical therapy (somatostatin analogs/dopamine agonists) is an important adjunct.",
